# Dependencies for this project are manager using pip-tools (https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools).
# This is a simple management tool to manage version pinnin build on top of Pip and requirements.txt.
# See upgrade commands here: https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/
# eg: pip-compile --upgrade-package django

# Please also refer to: https://gitlab.com/internet-cleanup-foundation/web-security-map/blob/master/docs/source/topics/development/development.md#python-dependencies-managment

# To keep this file clear and simple:
# - specify requirements that are needed for Websecmap runtime (no development requirements, they go into requirements-dev.in).
# - version pinning only if it is required and explained
# - only direct requirements, not recursive (requirements of requirements)

# When recompiling for mac: export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib

##
# Removed stuff

# proxybroker and it's dependency and requirements hell has been removed. It's replaced by 'get proxies elsewhere'
# which turned to be much more reliable and even cheaper (because it's faster and there is no list to maintain anymore)

# Django geojson was used for geojson fields in the "edit_area" of organizations. This was a GUI feature to
# edit coordinated visually. The geojsonfield has dependencies on gdal, and as such is impossible to work with
# as that requires the bleeding edge version of alpine linux (for over 2 years now). So we can't support this.
# Has been replaced with a normal jsonfield. When a need arises from a user, we can support it again (means = paid).

# typing was needed for python < 3.5
# Not needed with python < 3.5, we support 3.7 and up.

django
# Jet admin interface with several Django 3 fixes. Breaks the tab container + select2 lists. But it's better than
# nothing. Jet has not been maintained, even though it's been great, and alternatives are like 20 euro a month.
# This means we'll probably move to the (simpler) grapelli interface.
