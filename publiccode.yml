    shortDescription: >
      Creates geographical maps that in one
      image tells how well governments have
      implemented well known security standards.

    longDescription: >
      Web Security Map creates geographical maps that, in one image, show how well layers the Dutch government and
      other public institutions are adhering to well known security standards and practices. Security of these
      governments are graded using the colors of a traffic light. For example: imagine a map of your country with
      all municipalities, in the three traffic light colors.

      The solution is deployed publicly. This allows everyone to see what the current state of security is. It is
      aimed specifically at non-it knowledgeable people: the common citizen and C-level managers. This is intentional,
      as they are the driving force of creating budget to solve security issues. Citizens, in the end, are the ones
      negatively impacted when there is a lack of security.

      The project goes naming and shaming: it continuously re-measures the current state of security and stores all
      measurements over time. An improved security posture will thus be reflected publicly in a matter of days.
      We call this "faming", taken from the word "Fame".

      Every metric that is performed is published, which means there is a careful tradeoff on what to measure and
      what to display. For this various ethical guidelines have been set up in order to only support security and
      not cause damage. There are currently over 130 different metrics in the solution covering well known security
      practices such as correct domain ownership, physical location (and jurisdiction) of web and mail servers,
      preventing login portal exposure, anti spoofing for e-mail, security.txt, secure sites over https, dnssec,
      privacy, version number exposure and many more.

      Everyone can see these metrics, which are accompanied with documentation and a second opinion test link.

      The solution has many other views on the gathered data. For example a chart of what organizations are
      performing the best or the worst. It shows trend lines over time, it shows month-by-month comparison over
      each metric showing improvement (or degradation) and so on.

      The transparency that the solution has generated resulted in fixing well over 20.000 security issues and
      probably many more indirectly. In the Netherlands this initiatives measures about 50.000 internet domains
      such as rijksoverheid.nl.

      Please get in touch for installation support, information about what to expect, possible legal challenges and
      other first hand experience. We will support you in setting up and configuring the system, as this is fairly
      complex due to the different bells and whistles the system has.
