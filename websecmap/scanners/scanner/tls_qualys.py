"""
Manages endpoints:
 Protocols: https
 Ports: 443
 IP's: any related to a domain on mentioned protocols and ports.

Side effects from this scanner:
- This scanner harvests ips during scanning, which are stored as metadata.
- This scanner can discover new endpoints for port 443, protocol https, IPv4 or IPv6.
- Only urls not scanned in the past 7 days are eligible for scan.

Scans are severely rate limited using the Qualys API, trying to be as friendly as possible. If you want a faster
scan, use multiple scanners on different IP-addresses. A normal qualys scan takes about two minutes.

Be warned: the view of the internet from Qualys differs from yours. Some hosts block qualys or "foreign" traffic.

This scanner will be replaced with the O-Saft scanner when ready.
