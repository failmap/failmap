"""
Wildcard domains and services result in non-trusted certificates and a lot of unneeded domains.

This feature retrieves all wildcard domains from the database and will attempt to discover if the wildcard
site content matches a domain of that address. If that's the case, the url is marked as dead due to it going
to the same stuff as a regular wildcard page.
