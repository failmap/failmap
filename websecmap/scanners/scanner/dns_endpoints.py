"""
This discovers endpoints that are used for the Internet.NL scanners. The internet.nl scanners require only the
existence of AAAA or A DNS records for web and SOA for mail. This means this discovery will find DNS-record type
endpoints that equal normal endpoints. Except they don't have a port and ip_version.

It's not worth the while to make a new, special, 'DNS endpoint' type, as the reporting and life cycle will be just
the same. So to save a lot of pain and trouble, we'll just fill the port and ip_version with 0.

# todo: can we check if the mail is routed outside of the country somehow? Due to privacy concerns / GDPR?

def has_soa(url: str):
    """
    The SOA records is the primary check for internet.nl mail. If there is a SOA
    record, you can run a mail scan. It's unclear at the time of writing why this is.
    This is used on internet.nl dashboard

    internet.nl uses unbound do perform this check, which is very heavy and does a lot of things probably
    a lot cleaner and better. The build instructions are here:
    https://github.com/NLnetLabs/Internet.nl/blob/5f56202848e7a71d1a7dd8204d39b8f1246bbe34/docker/Dockerfile

    But still, since the queries are so simple, we prefer not to use it.

    In "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/Internet.nl/blob/cece8255ac7f39bded137f67c94a10748970c3c7/checks/views/shared.py"
    we see get_valid_domain_mai using unbound with RR_TYPE_SOA. This means not only SOA on the current subdomain,
    but getting ANY soa record back is fine.

    The domain itself does not need to be authoritive for them. Which means basically scan everything.
    Can we find a domain that does not have a SOA record?

    This is OK;  casdasdasdvdr.overheid.nl  as dig  casdasdasdvdr.overheid.nl SOA returns overheid.nl as one of it's
    results.

    asdkansdkansdkl.blockchainpilots.nl is not ok. as it has only the nl. in authority section.

    Is there an option in dnspython's resolver.query that might emulate this behavior?
    We can't blindly use the parents domain, as that is not how DNS works :)

    We're simulating:
    cb_data = ub_resolve_with_timeout(
        dname, unbound.RR_TYPE_SOA, unbound.RR_CLASS_IN, timeout)

    in DNSPython:
    def query(qname, rdtype=dns.rdatatype.A, rdclass=dns.rdataclass.IN,
          tcp=False, source=None, raise_on_no_answer=True,
          source_port=0, lifetime=None):

    Comparison:

                    unbound                 | dnspython
    domain_name |   dname                   | qname
    type:       |   unbound.RR_TYPE_SOA     |  "SOA" (could differ)
    rdclass:    |   unbound.RR_CLASS_IN     | dns.rdataclass.IN (default)

    Our best bet is that "SOA" is not the same as RR_TYPE_SOA, or dns.rdatatype.SOA... so let's try that.
    dns.rdatatype.SOA and "SOA" deliver the same result: it does not exist. So why does it exist on internet.nl?

    internet.nl does use get_valid_domain_mail to validate and perform the resolving function...
    https://github.com/NLnetLabs/Internet.nl/blob/9f0cfb5baffbe76b4e28cda297093b0e0aef8fae/checks/batch/util.py

    The difference in internet.nl is dat the resolve DOES get something back, even if its not a SOA...

    "
    def get_valid_domain_mail(mailaddr, timeout=5):
    dname = validate_dname(mailaddr)
    if dname is None:
        return None

    cb_data = ub_resolve_with_timeout(
        dname, unbound.RR_TYPE_SOA, unbound.RR_CLASS_IN, timeout)

    if cb_data.get("nxdomain") and cb_data["nxdomain"]:
        return None

    return dname
    "

    If we look at vars((resolver.query("data.overheid.nl", "SOA", raise_on_no_answer=False).response))
    then we see there is an authority section. Since unbound is a recursive dns resolver, it might just attempt
    to retrieve the answer from the authority.

    In this example we see that this is happening, and the NXdomain check is also performed. Thus the
    recursivity is the actual thing that differs.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4066614/how-can-i-find-the-authoritative-dns-server-for-a-domain-using-dnspython

    Of course, we're not going to write recursive code, as this is a very common problem, and a solution
    is likely waiting for us.

    Internet.nl uses this specific version of unbound:
    https://github.com/ralphdolmans/unbound/blob/internetnl/README.md

    The real difference it seems is that we do accept "no answer", but do not accept "nxdomain" issues. We can
    also see this when looking at get_valid_domain_web, that seems to really look at the data.

    Test it like this:
    from websecmap.organizations.models import Url
    from websecmap.scanners.scanner import dns_endpoints
    dns_endpoints.has_soa(Url(url="www.arnhem.nl"))

    The answer returned does not evaluate as True or False.

    So the check is not really 'IF' there is a SOA record, because there is not at data.overheid.nl. But
    that you get an answer, and any answer is basically fine.
