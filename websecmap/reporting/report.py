    Update 12 nov 2018: If there are multiple changes per day on the url on the same issue, this might not give the

    some reason, the ERROR one gets in the report, while the last_scan_moment of the INFO one is more recent.
    The one with the highest last_scan_moment (the newest) should be added to the report, the other one can be
    ignored.

    Example input:
    ID      Last Scan Moment            Rating Determined On      Type      Rating

    :return: All scans, for all dates and multiple types, with the scan with the highest scan moment per type+date

    Actually the reporting code is optimized to filter out double scans for a single day, and it takes the last one.
    But still we want to be sure the result is clean. Does that mean we can only accept one report per day?
    Why? There are multiple moments and multiple dates. And one scan always comes after the other.

    So why do we only have one report per day. And why is the rating_determined_on ignored?
    We do this otherwise every change would lead to a new report, which generates an enormous growth in the number
    of reports. To give an impression:

    On Novemer 2018 the following is in the database:
    URL Generic Scans: 1850
    TLS Scans: 29345
    Endpoint generic scans: 173998
    TOTAL: 205.193 changes in scans. Would we create a report containing each of these changes, we'd have the same
    amount of reports.

    Using reduction per day, we only have a total of 61377 URL ratings, which is about a fourth of the total and
    it only has 24252 organization ratings, which is just over 10%. An organization rating of Rotterdam is about
    1.5 megabyte of JSON in total. (<1 Megabyte without the whitespace). Would an average rating be 500 KB:
    500000kb * 24252 reports = 12126000000kb = 12.126 gigabyte. (with compression etc) it is now just ±1 gigabyte.

    So imagine it's 10x more, the DB would be 10 gigabyte at least: all to have a minute accuracy improvement which
    basically nobody cares about. A day resolution is more than enough.

    This is the reason functions like this exist, to just help and optimize the amount of storage.

    It's possible to have scans from a series of endpoints/urls.
